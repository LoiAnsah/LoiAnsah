👋🏼 Hi there! I’m Ama—a passionate problem-solver who loves everything related to software development, algorithms, and numbers.

👩🏾‍💻 My journey revolves around coding, mathematical problem-solving, and hands-on projects. I’m constantly exploring new programming languages, building applications, and deepening my understanding of software development and mathematical modeling. I love tackling challenges that merge mathematics and coding, whether it’s through data structures, machine learning, or algorithm optimization.

🚀 Currently, I’m seeking an internship to apply my programming skills in real-world projects, contribute to impactful software solutions, and continue growing as a developer.

🌿 Feel free to reach me at loiscodes@gmail.com or simply message me—I’d love to connect! 😊
